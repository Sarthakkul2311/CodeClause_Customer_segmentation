# Customer Segmentation

In this project, I worked on a real-world e-commerce sales data and segmented its customer base with Python, [scikit-learn library](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html) and [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/plotly-express/). 

# Overview
Customer segmentation is a powerful technique used in marketing and data analysis to identify groups of customers with similar characteristics and behaviors. By dividing customers into segments, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies and optimize their resources to better meet the needs of their customers.

This project provides a step-by-step guide for performing customer segmentation using Python. The process involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and clustering algorithms

# Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn

# The workflow of the project is as follows:
1. Business Case
2. Data Preparation
3. Segmentation with K-means Clustering
4. Hyperparameter Tuning
5. Visualization and Interpretation of the Results
